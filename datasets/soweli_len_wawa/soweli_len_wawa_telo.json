    "output": "1. Eat a balanced and nutritious diet: Make sure your meals are inclusive of a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and healthy fats. This helps to provide your body with the essential nutrients to function at its best and can help prevent chronic diseases.\n\n2. Engage in regular physical activity: Exercise is crucial for maintaining strong bones, muscles, and cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week.\n\n3. Get enough sleep: Getting enough quality sleep is crucial for physical and mental well-being. It helps to regulate mood, improve cognitive function, and supports healthy growth and immune function. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "An atom is the basic building block of all matter and is made up of three types of particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The structure of an atom can be described as a nucleus at the center surrounded by a cloud of electrons.\n\nThe nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles and neutrons are neutral particles with no charge. Both of these particles are located in the nucleus of the atom, which is at the center of the atom and contains most of the atom's mass.\n\nSurrounding the nucleus of the atom is a cloud of electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that are in constant motion around the nucleus. The electron cloud is divided into shells or orbitals, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The number of electrons in the outermost shell, called the valence shell, determines the chemical properties of the atom. \n\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the electron cloud, so the positive and negative charges balance out and the atom has no overall charge. The number of protons, also called the atomic number, determines what element the atom is.",

Strong things and things without strength are in the core. Small things move on the surface. The number of strong things is the same as the number of small things. This number tells the name of the small thing."
