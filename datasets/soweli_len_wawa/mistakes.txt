Unplug devices when not in use: Many electronic devices such as chargers, TVs, and computers consume power even when they are turned off. Unplug devices when they’re not in use to reduce electricity consumption.\n\n5. Use smart power strips: Consider using smart power strips, which automatically cut power to devices that are not in use, thereby reducing standby power consumption.\n\n6. Adjust the thermostat: Heating and cooling can account for up to half of a home’s total energy consumption. Adjust the thermostat and use programmable or smart thermostats to reduce heating or cooling usage when no one is at home, or at night.\n\n7.

"instruction": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nFounded in the 13th century, Berlin has had an eventful history. Excavations from 2008 suggest that the city may be even older than was previously assumed: state archaeologists have discovered an oak beam that probably dates back to 1183.\n\nAlmost no other metropolis has experienced such frequent, radical change transforming the face of the city. Although Berlin saw steady growth in its importance, dazzling epochs alternated with darker eras. Nevertheless, the formerly divided city has succeeded in becoming a vibrant metropolis in the heart of Europe.\n\nQuestion: What is the best restaurant in Berlin?",

"instruction": "Explain why the given definition is wrong.",
"input": "A mole is an animal that lives underground.",
"output": "While it is true that a mole is an animal that lives underground, this definition is incomplete and could be misunderstood because it does not adequately describe the mole's characteristics or biological classification. Moles belong to the family of mammals called Talpidae, and they are small, burrowing, and insectivorous. They are known for their cylindrical bodies, short limbs, and small eyes and ears. The definition also does not differentiate the animal from the chemical term mole, which refers to a unit of measurement used in chemistry. For these reasons, the given definition of a mole is not entirely accurate or clearly descriptive.",
